# Subject: Lighting Equipment Available for Donation — Inventory Attached

Hi Ean,

I'm reaching out about a batch of lighting equipment that IDM received as a donation. We've gone through the full inventory and set aside what we need for Navy Yard, so the remaining fixtures are available if Media Commons Garage could use them.

Here's what we're keeping at Navy Yard:
- 19× LED Fresnel 320W (5600K)
- 16× LED Cyclorama RGBW 350W
- 2× LED Ellipsoidal 200W (5600K)

Everything else from the inventory is available. That includes:

**Fixtures:**
- 39× LED Fresnel 320W (3200K) — Leviton LFD32-30B
- 9× LED Ellipsoidal Body 200W (5600K) — Leviton LED00-50B
- 7× LED Ellipsoidal Body 200W (3200K) — Leviton LED00-30B
- 26× Lens Tubes (17× 18-36°, 5× 30-50°, 4× 8-22°)
- 26× Barn Doors for Fresnel
- 30× Multi-Lens PAR (750W, traditional lamp)

The full inventory with model numbers, spec sheets, and photos is here:

Let me know if any of this would be useful for the Garage, and we can figure out the donation process from there.

Best,
Dazai
